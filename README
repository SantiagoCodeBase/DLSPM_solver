Code repository for the paper "On Analytical and Numerical Approaches to Division and Label Structured Population Models".

structured_population_model_log_flux.m - This matlab script compares Lax-Wendroff (LxW) to Recursive Numerical Integration (RNI) for solving a structured population model system of PDEs.

solver/ - This folder contains code for solving an initial-boundary value problem for a first order system of hyperbolic PDEs.
